## How to use the Terminal Class

### Indexes

- When adding, removing or editing the content of the table the headers dont count as a row/col so the first row will still have the index 0
- The specified index also works the same as in standart python list
- This means you can access the first element with 0, the second with 1 and so on
- You can also access the last element with -1, second last with -2, and so on
